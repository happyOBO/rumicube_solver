## Rummicube Solver

I like the RummiCube board game. I have a strong desire to win. I wondered if it was a losing game because the cards I received in the RummiCube game were not good or if I lost because I was not good enough.
 

## How to play

It starts with 14 tiles, each for 2-4 people. Combine and put down the tiles you have on the table according to the rules, so that the person who puts down all the tiles he/she has and burns them out wins.

## Rule

### Resister

Before combining the cards at the table, you must set them up through the procedure called Registration. The initial registration is subject to the following conditions:
- You have to do it with the tiles you have.
- The tile value must be at least 30. (Tile values are the numbers engraved on the tiles.)
Laying tiles on the table shall be arranged according to the following conditions.
### Play

- a combination of three or more numbers in the same color.
- a combination of three or four numbers of the same value for different colors.

## To Do List

- [x] ~~enter the 14 tiles received by color.~~
- [x] ~~get iput usig ```map```~~
- [ ] Among the 14 tiles received, select the ones that can be registered.
- [ ] Comming soon..
